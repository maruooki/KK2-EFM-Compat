# KK2-EFM-Compat
This is a resource pack/datapack that attempts to port over the correct animations from KH games over to Kingdom Keys 2 using Epic Fight Mod. I'll try to have each weapon accurate to the game it originates from (e.g. Sleeping Lion having KH2 anims).

Currently, I only have the KH2 Anims, but I will be exporting all animations from all games eventually if possible. I'm focusing on Keyblades first, then I'll try to get Org XIII weapons after.
